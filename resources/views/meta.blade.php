    <meta name="description" content="Lilian Anneloes (1997) is a Dutch feminist activist visual artist and writer.  

Her work, mostly consisting of drawing, film and writing, revolves around intersectional feminist topics such as gender, sex, sexuality, or observations of privilege, but related personal experiences and (institutional) critique also play a part within all three media she employs.

Lilian graduated Fine Art at the Minerva Art Academy in Groningen in 2018 and is currently working on receiving her masters degree in Art History (Modern and Contemporary art) at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.">
